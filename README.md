# ProfiSounder

ProfiSounder is a little java-based tool that plays soundfiles depending on the (virtual) socket states contolled by a [GHL Profilux 3 ex](https://aquariumcomputer.com) or later controller with network connection, for instance, during simulated thunderstorms, rainy days or just as an audio feedback.
